  title: DemoKin - Matrix-based Kinship Models
  description: >
    An R package for demographic analysis of kinship networks using 
    matrix-based models. DemoKin implements a range of methods for 
    estimating kin counts, age distributions, and other family structure 
    dynamics under various demographic assumptions.
