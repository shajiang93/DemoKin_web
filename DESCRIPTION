Description: Tools for demographic analysis of kinship networks using matrix-based 
    models. DemoKin implements a range of methods for estimating kin counts, 
    age distributions, and other family structure dynamics under various 
    demographic assumptions. The package includes functions for one-sex and 
    two-sex models, time-invariant and time-varying approaches, and can 
    incorporate additional dimensions like parity or educational attainment.
